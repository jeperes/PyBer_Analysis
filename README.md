# PyBer_Analysis

## Resources

1. Python 3.7.6
2. JupyterLab

## Overview
The purpose of this project is create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer, based on the types of cities (Urban, suburban and Rural) in order to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Some functions like, groupy(), sum(), count() and line charts are used to perform this analysis. 

## Results

Upon visualisation of the image above, we can conclude that:

1. Uban cities have the largest amount of rides, drivers and fares.
2. Rural cities have the least amount of rides, drivers and fares.
3. The lowest average fare is in the Urban cities, even that they have the higest results.
4. Rural cities have the least rides, drivers and fares, but the average fares amount is the largest compared to Urban and Suburban.

In the following image we are able to see the line chart of the Total fare by city of 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28.

## Recommendations

1. The low total rides and fares in the rural cities could be a result of low drivers amount, I would suggest an increase of the drivers in this area.
2. There are too many drivers in the urban areas, it's the only category where the drivers out number the rides, resulting in low earnings per driver. Recommend less hiring in urban.
3. To better understand the disparity of fares, recommend adding avergae miles per ride per category, as one can assume that rural drivers will have longer drives however this is just an assumption without data
